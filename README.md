# Tic Tac Toe, but in C#!!!!

Doing this for personal practice, getting a better understanding of how things work after not touching it for a while. It is only ran via terminal/cmd so please feel free to try it out.

## Future plans

- Maybe add a CPU to play in place of player 2, will have to learn how to do that effectively.
